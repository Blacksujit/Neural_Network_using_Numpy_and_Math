# Neural Network XOR Predictor

# Interesting part about this neural network:

## facinated by an repo and thaught how can be a neural network be prepared from scratch from just using numpy and maths no tensorflow , no pytorch just pure basics

Welcome to the Neural Network XOR Predictor! 🎉 This project demonstrates a simple neural network that learns and predicts the XOR logic gate. It showcases the power of neural networks and provides an interactive web interface to explore neural network predictions.
