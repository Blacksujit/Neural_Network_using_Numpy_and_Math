# Neural Network XOR Predictor

# Interesting part about this neural network:

## facinated by an repo and thaught how can be a neural network be prepared from scratch from just using numpy and maths no tensorflow , no pytorch jsut pure basics

Welcome to the Neural Network XOR Predictor! 🎉 This project demonstrates a simple neural network that learns and predicts the XOR logic gate. It showcases the power of neural networks and provides an interactive web interface to explore neural network predictions.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Neural Network Training**: Trains a neural network to predict the XOR logic gate using Python and NumPy.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Flask and HTML/CSS to input values and get predictions in real-time.
- **Visualization**: Includes a Plotly-based animation to visualize the neural network layers.
- **Educational Video**: Embedded YouTube video explaining how neural networks work.

## 📋 Project Structure


Here's a beautiful README file for your project, designed to be engaging and informative. You can create a README.md file in your project directory and use the following content.
